        \textbf{Signal} & \textbf{Definition} \\
        \texttt{Ack.bytes\_acked}, \texttt{Ack.packets\_acked} & Number of bytes received in order in a call to \ct{OnCongestionEvent} before the first lost packet, from the \ct{AckedPackets} vector passed in as an argument \\
        \texttt{Ack.bytes\_misordered}, \texttt{Ack.packets\_misordered} & Number of bytes received in the \ct{AckedPackets} vector with a sequence number greater than the sequence number of the first lost packet. \\
        \texttt{Ack.lost\_pkts\_sample} & Number of lost packets, i.e. size of the \ct{LostPackets} passed into the \ct{OnCongestionEvent} function. \\
        \texttt{Ack.now} & C++ Standard library wall clock time\\
        \texttt{Flow.was\_timeout} & True when \ct{OnRetransmissionTimeout} is called \\
