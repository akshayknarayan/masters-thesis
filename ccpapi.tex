\chapter{CCP API Capabilities}
In this chapter, we discuss whether the CCP API can provide exactly what the QUIC pluggable congestion control interface provides.
As evidenced by the congestion window comparison graphs in Chapter~\ref{performance}, QUIC's Reno and Cubic vary slightly from the CCP versions of these algorithms.
One source of difference is that QUIC implements slightly different algorithms: in particular, QUIC implements hybrid slow start, instead of regular slow start.
Another source of difference is that QUIC implements a variant of mulTCP for the cubic congestion control algorithm, most notably emulating two connections rather than one.
We try to implement exactly the same algorithm in QUIC through CCP, and redo some of the congestion window evolution experiments, to see how close of a match we can get through CCP.
