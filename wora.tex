\chapter{Write Once, Run Anywhere}
CCP allows developers to write an algorithm once and automatically run it on multiple datapaths.
Now, we can compare the exact same algorithm running across two different datapaths, to see what the differences between the datapaths actually are. In this section, we study the case of comparing the Linux kernel datapath with the QUIC datapath.
In addition, now, with CCP, we demonstrate some new algorithms implemented for the first time in QUIC: Copa and Remy.
\section{Current Algorithms}
\begin{itemize}
    \item BBR, Cubic, Reno: compare in QUIC vs. Kernel
\end{itemize}
\section{New Algorithms}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Copa, Remy (?)
\end{itemize}
